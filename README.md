## About
These repositories will be about my projects that I am working on, one that links to my page as well, and some other side projects and open-source projects too.
## Recommended Tools
- To create your website, you will first need a GitHub account. You can sign up for an account at github.com.

- For pushing and pulling code to and from the repository, I would recommend getting GitHub Desktop. Itâ€™s very easy to use, especially for beginners.

- Lastly, I would recommend Visual Studio Code in order to edit the Markdown files that you will use for the website. A link for assistance with Markdown can be found below.
