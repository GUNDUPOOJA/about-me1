## about
This repository is for the Northwest Missouri State University Class: Developing Web Apps and Services to introduce Gundu pooja and to get to know what tools I like to use for web development.

## Recommended Tools
In order to publish a page to git hub pages the following things are strongly recommended.

1. Access to a computer with a secure internet connection
1. A github account with a long password
1. A repository with at least a README.md or a index.md and some content in those files.

 These things are the bare minimum, I would say, to publish a page with github pages. To take your github page to the next level, I would reccommend installing git or some git client on your machine and a text editor to get really fancy.

## Recommended Resources
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- [github](https://github.com)
- [Editing your Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

 These are all good resources for answering any questions one may have during web development.
